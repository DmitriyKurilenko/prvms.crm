# Changelog

## [0.18.0] — 2026-06-25

### Added — Call transcription and AI summary (DEC-056)

**Call recordings can now be transcribed (Deepgram) and summarized (Hermes LLM).** The summary lands in the deal timeline; gated by the new `ai_call_intelligence` feature.

- Backend:
  - `apps/telephony/deepgram_client.py`: isolated Deepgram pre-recorded ASR client (contract verified by a live API call).
  - `apps/telephony/models.py`: added `CallTranscript` (migration `telephony/0004`).
  - `apps/telephony/tasks.py`: `transcribe_call_record` → `summarize_call`, chained from `download_call_record`; summary written as a timeline `Activity`.
  - `apps/ai_assistant/services.py`: `summarize_call_text` helper reusing the Hermes chat endpoint.
  - `apps/telephony/api.py`: transcript fields in the call list, plus `transcribe/` and `transcript/` endpoints.
  - `apps/billing/migrations/0009`: seeds the `ai_call_intelligence` feature.
  - `config/settings.py`: `DEEPGRAM_*` settings.
- Frontend:
  - `frontend/src/views/TelephonyView.vue`: "AI summary" column with a transcribe button.
  - `frontend/src/api/telephony.ts`: transcribe/transcript API and types.
- Tests: `apps/telephony/tests/test_call_intelligence.py` (8).

### Fixed — Hermes OpenCode runtime config (DEC-057)

Hermes is now configured without running the interactive setup wizard. The project seeds a writable Hermes profile volume with an OpenCode config and CRM skills, and Django sends the API server model id (`hermes-agent`) instead of a tenant slug.

- Added `config/hermes/config.yaml` and `config/hermes/init.sh`.
- Added `hermes-init` to dev/prod compose; added `hermes` to production compose.
- Standardized env examples on `OPENCODE_API_KEY`, `HERMES_MODEL=hermes-agent`.
- Verified live Hermes `/health`, `/v1/models`, and `/v1/chat/completions` through OpenCode.

## [0.17.1] — 2026-06-23

### Improved — User guide refresh

**The in-app help content has been brought in line with the current CRM interface.** The user guide now follows the live sidebar order and covers the product areas added in recent releases.

- Reworked `docs/user-guide/README.md` and the numbered guide structure to match the current app menu.
- Split the old built-in CRM guide into separate articles for contacts, companies, products, web forms, deals, tags, automation, tasks, calendar, analytics, sales targets, data tools, pipelines and chats.
- Updated guides for channels, documents/signing, telephony, integrations, team management, role permissions, distribution, audit, notifications, settings and subscription.
- Rewrote telephony guidance for MTS Exolve instead of the old FreeSWITCH flow.
- Added coverage for new user-facing sections: products, web forms, tags, automation, calendar, sales targets, import/export, chats and AI assistant.
- Removed obsolete guide files from the previous numbering.

## [0.17.0] — 2026-06-23

### Added — Sales targets and funnel analytics (DEC-055)

## [0.16.0] — 2026-06-22

### Added — Calendar, reminders and recurring tasks (DEC-054)

**The built-in CRM now has a calendar with task reminders and recurrence.** Tasks appear in month/week/day views, can be created from the calendar, repeat on a schedule (RRULE), and notify the responsible user ahead of the due time.

- Backend:
  - `apps/crm/models.py`: added `recurrence_rule` (RRULE), `remind_at`, `reminder_sent_at` to `Activity` (migration `crm/0011`).
  - `apps/crm/services/recurrence.py`: `next_occurrence` via `python-dateutil` (contract verified against the installed package).
  - `apps/crm/activities_api.py`: spawns the next occurrence when a recurring task is completed; added the `activities/calendar/` range endpoint.
  - `apps/notifications/models.py` and `services.py`: added the `task_reminder` event and the user-targeted `notify_user` helper.
  - `apps/crm/tasks.py` and `config/settings.py`: added the periodic `send_task_reminders` task (idempotent via `reminder_sent_at`).
  - `apps/notifications/migrations/0003` (alter choices) and `0004` (idempotent backfill of `task_reminder` preferences for existing tenants).
  - `requirements.txt`: pinned `python-dateutil==2.9.0.post0`.
- Frontend:
  - `frontend/src/views/CalendarView.vue`: FullCalendar 6.1.21 (chosen over the EOL/untyped vue-cal) with month/week/day views, a task dialog with recurrence presets + raw RRULE, reminder offset, and a complete action.

- Tests: `apps/crm/tests/test_calendar_reminders.py` (9), `frontend/e2e/calendar.spec.ts`.

## [0.15.0] — 2026-06-22

### Added — Import/export and duplicate detection/merge for contacts and companies (DEC-053)

**The built-in CRM now imports and exports the client base and merges duplicates.** Owners/admins/managers can upload CSV or XLSX files, export to CSV, and find and merge duplicate contacts or companies. Scope is contacts and companies (deals deferred).

- Backend:
  - `apps/crm/models.py`: added `ImportJob` (migration `crm/0010`).
  - `apps/crm/services/import_export.py`: CSV/XLSX parser (`openpyxl==3.1.5`, contract verified against the installed package) and BOM-prefixed CSV export.
  - `apps/crm/services/merge.py`: duplicate search and transactional merge of contacts/companies, moving related deals/activities and filling empty fields.

  - `frontend/src/api/crm.ts`, `frontend/src/router/index.ts`, `frontend/src/layout/AppMenu.vue`: API functions/types, route, and menu item.
- Tests: `apps/crm/tests/test_import_merge.py` (12), `frontend/e2e/data-tools.spec.ts`.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-06-22

### Added — Automation builder and SLA-style time rules (DEC-052)

**The built-in CRM now supports configurable automation rules.** Owners and admins can create "if → then" rules that react to deal events or inactivity and run actions automatically.

- Backend:
  - `apps/crm/models.py`: added `AutomationRule` and `AutomationRunLog`.
  - `apps/crm/services/auto_actions.py`: extracted reusable `execute_action(action, deal)` and added event rule evaluation while keeping `process_stage_change` as the compatibility wrapper.
  - `apps/crm/deals_api.py`: evaluates `new_deal` and `stage_changed` rules from deal creation and stage movement endpoints.
  - `apps/crm/tasks.py` and `config/settings.py`: added the periodic `evaluate_time_rules` task for `no_activity` rules.
  - `apps/crm/automation_api.py`: added CRUD endpoints for automation rules, restricted to owner/admin roles.

- Frontend:
  - Added the "Автоматизации" section, route, menu entry, and API client methods.
  - Added `frontend/src/views/AutomationView.vue` for the first rule builder UI.
  - Added Playwright coverage for creating an automation rule in the SPA.
- Migrations:
  - `apps/crm/migrations/0009_automationrule_automationrunlog.py`

### Documentation

- Added `DEC-052`.
- Updated `docs/TASK_STATE.md`, `docs/DEV_LOG.md`, `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, and `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md`.

**Validation:** `crm/0009` migration checked without drift; `manage.py check` 0 issues; targeted backend tests passed for automation plus auto-action regression; `docker compose run --rm lint` passed; frontend typecheck/build passed; Playwright `automation.spec.ts` passed.

## [0.13.0] — 2026-06-21

### Added — Email channel, web forms, tags and segments (DEC-049, DEC-050, DEC-051)

**This release adds three user-facing CRM capabilities on top of the 0.10.0 catalog release.** It introduces two-way email as a communication channel, tenant-managed web lead forms with an embeddable widget, and the first version of tags/segments for contacts and deals.

- Email channel:
  - Added `email` as a messenger channel type with IMAP polling, SMTP sending, message deduplication by `Message-ID`, and normalized delivery into the existing chat/message pipeline.
  - Added email parsing with text fallback from HTML and attachment metadata extraction.
  - Added frontend IMAP/SMTP fields to the channel form and Playwright coverage for creating an email channel.
- Web forms:
  - Added tenant-scoped `WebForm` plus public `WebFormLookup` so public tokens can resolve the correct tenant.
  - Added public schema/submit endpoints with honeypot, rate limiting, CORS handling, and intake logic that creates a contact and deal.
  - Added the "Веб-формы" builder in the SPA, the `webforms` permission entity, and the static embeddable widget at `frontend/public/widget/crm-webform.js`.
- Tags and segments:
  - Added `Tag` and `Segment` models, CRUD APIs, tag assignment endpoints for contacts/deals, and `tag_id` filtering in contact/deal lists.
  - Added the "Теги" SPA section and menu entry.
  - Tags reuse existing `contacts`/`deals` permissions instead of introducing a separate RBAC entity.
- Migrations:
  - `apps/channels/migrations/0003_alter_messengerchannel_channel_type.py`
  - `apps/crm/migrations/0007_webform.py`
  - `apps/crm/migrations/0008_segment_tag.py`
  - `apps/tenants/migrations/0007_webformlookup.py`
  - `apps/users/migrations/0005_alter_rolepermission_entity.py`

### Documentation

- Added `DEC-049`, `DEC-050`, and `DEC-051`.
- Updated `docs/TASK_STATE.md`, `docs/DEV_LOG.md`, `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, and `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md`.

**Validation:** migrations checked without drift; `manage.py check` 0 issues; targeted backend tests for email channels, web forms, tags, and RBAC passed; `docker compose run --rm lint` passed; frontend typecheck/build passed; Playwright e2e passed for `email-channel.spec.ts`, `webforms.spec.ts`, and `tags.spec.ts`; live SMTP/IMAP round-trip and public webform POST were confirmed.

---

## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-21

### Added — Product catalog and deal line items (DEC-047)

**The built-in CRM now has a product catalog and deal line items.** Deals can be calculated from selected products/services instead of only a manually entered amount.

- Backend:
  - `apps/crm/models.py`: added `Product`, `ProductCategory`, and `DealItem`; deal items keep name, price, and VAT snapshots at the time they are added.
  - `apps/crm/services/pricing.py`: centralized deal amount recalculation with `ROUND_HALF_UP` rounding.
  - `apps/crm/products_api.py` and `apps/crm/deal_items_api.py`: catalog CRUD and deal item APIs.
  - `apps/crm/deals_api.py`: manual `amount` updates are ignored while a deal has line items.
  - `apps/documents/mapping.py`: document context now includes `items`, `subtotal`, `vat`, `total`, and `has_items`.
  - `apps/users/permissions.py` and `apps/users/models.py`: added the `products` CRM permission entity.
- Frontend:
  - Added the "Товары" section and route.
  - Added the "Позиции" tab to the deal detail page.
  - The deal amount field is locked when line items are present because the amount is derived from the item totals.
  - Added product permissions to the role permissions matrix.
- Migrations:
  - `apps/crm/migrations/0006_*`
  - `apps/users/migrations/0004_*`

### Added — Local validation gates (DEC-048)

- `Dockerfile.dev` and `docker-compose.yml`: added a `lint` service under the `tools` profile for local `ruff check .`.
- `frontend/playwright.config.ts`, `frontend/e2e/*`, and package scripts: added Playwright e2e coverage for product catalog and deal line items.
- `docker-compose.yml`: added `seed` and `e2e` services under the `tools` profile; `docker compose run --rm e2e` is self-contained and starts the backend plus seed step.
- `.gitignore`: ignored Playwright reports and test artifacts.
- `AGENTS.md`: validation baseline now requires ruff for Python changes and e2e for UI/SPA changes.

### Documentation

- Added `DEC-047` and `DEC-048`.
- Updated `docs/TASK_STATE.md`, `docs/DEV_LOG.md`, `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, and `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md`.
- Added implementation/spec documents under `docs/specs/`.

**Validation:** migration drift check for `crm/0006` and `users/0004`; `manage.py check` 0 issues; **33/33** targeted backend tests for catalog/RBAC; frontend `typecheck` clean; `vite build` successful; vitest **11/11**; `docker compose run --rm lint` clean; `docker compose run --rm e2e` Playwright **2/2** passed.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-21

### Changed — Auto-generate organization slug during registration (DEC-046)

**The registration form no longer asks users to fill in the organization slug.** The slug is now generated automatically by the CRM from the organization name.

- `apps/tenants/services.py`: added `generate_tenant_slug(name)` helper with Russian-Cyrillic transliteration, `slugify`, fallback to `org`, and uniqueness resolution via numeric suffix while respecting `SlugField(max_length=50)`.
- `apps/users/auth_api.py`: removed `org_slug` from `RegisterIn`; `register()` now calls `generate_tenant_slug(payload.org_name)` and uses the result for `Tenant.slug`, `Tenant.schema_name`, and `Domain.domain`.
- `frontend/src/views/RegisterView.vue`: removed the slug input field, `orgSlug` ref, `syncSlug()`, and local `slugify()`.
- `frontend/src/api/auth.ts`: removed `org_slug` from `RegisterPayload`.
- Tests:
  - `apps/users/tests/test_auth_api.py` — updated registration test to stop sending `org_slug`; added tests for slug generation from name, Cyrillic transliteration, and collision handling.
  - `apps/billing/tests/test_pricing_calculator.py` — free-custom registration no longer sends `org_slug`; created tenant is looked up via response `tenant_slug`.
- Docs: `docs/DECISIONS.md` (DEC-046), `docs/TASK_STATE.md`, `docs/DEV_LOG.md`, `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md`.

**Validation:** `docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build`; `manage.py check` 0 issues; `makemigrations --check --dry-run` no changes; ruff (F/E/B/BLE/I) clean; backend tests **54/54** for affected apps (`apps.users`, `apps.tenants`, `apps.billing`), including **9/9** auth API tests and **13/13** pricing calculator tests; frontend `typecheck` EXIT=0, `build` EXIT=0, `vitest` **11/11**; manual `POST /api/auth/register` without `org_slug` returns 201 with generated `tenant_slug`.

---

## [0.8.3] — 2026-06-21

### Fixed — Production SMTP egress for Celery

After switching to the SMTP backend, Celery workers in the production stack failed to resolve/connect to the external SMTP host (`smtp.beget.com`) with `socket.gaierror: [Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution`.

- `docker-compose.prod.yml`: attached the `celery` service to the external `traefik` network in addition to the internal `backend` network. The `backend` network has `internal: true`, which blocks outbound traffic; `traefik` provides the required internet egress for SMTP. No Traefik labels are added to `celery`, so it remains unreachable from the outside.
- `apps/notifications/tasks.py`: added `autoretry_for=(smtplib.SMTPException, OSError)`, exponential backoff, and `max_retries=3` to `send_email_async` for resilience against transient network failures.
- Docs: updated `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/DEV_LOG.md`, `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.

**Validation:** `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml config` passes; `manage.py check` 0 issues; ruff (F/E/B/BLE/I) clean; **134/134** backend tests.

---

## [0.8.2] — 2026-06-21

### Fixed — Landing contact form email delivery (DEC-045)

**Form "Написать нам" on the landing page now sends emails to the configured address.**

The `POST /api/public/pricing/telephony-request/` handler saved requests to the DB and queued emails, but letters were never delivered: `EMAIL_BACKEND` was `console`, SMTP parameters were not forwarded from the hosting environment, and there was no dedicated recipient env variable. Hosting (Beget) uses nodemailer-style env names (`SMTP_HOST/SMTP_PORT/SMTP_SECURE/SMTP_USER/SMTP_PASS`, `CONTACT_TO/CONTACT_FROM`), not Django's `EMAIL_*` names.

- `config/settings.py`: hosting env vars mapped to Django mail contract (`SMTP_HOST→EMAIL_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT→EMAIL_PORT`, `SMTP_USER→EMAIL_HOST_USER`, `SMTP_PASS→EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`, `CONTACT_FROM→DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`, `CONTACT_TO→SUPPORT_EMAIL`). Nodemailer `secure` translated to mutually exclusive `EMAIL_USE_SSL`/`EMAIL_USE_TLS`.
- `apps/billing/public_views.py`: source detection (`landing-contact` vs telephony calculator), readable subject + body (Name/Phone/Email/Message instead of JSON dump), recipient `SUPPORT_EMAIL or DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`, logging on enqueue with warning if recipient is unset.
- `apps/notifications/tasks.py`: `send_email_async` logs `delivered=<N>` and catches narrow `(smtplib.SMTPException, OSError)` with traceback.
- env files: `.env` switched to smtp backend; `.env.example` and `.env.prod.example` enriched with `SMTP_*`/`CONTACT_*` blocks.
- Tests: `apps/billing/tests/test_pricing_calculator.py` — +2 cases with mocked `send_email_async.delay`.

**Validation:** `manage.py check` 0 issues; ruff (F/E/B/BLE/I) clean on affected files; **134/134** backend tests. Live probe: POST form → HTTP 200, celery `delivered=1` (Beget accepted via SSL/465).

**Hotfix (2026-06-21):** eliminated silent fallback to `console.EmailBackend` when `SMTP_HOST` is configured — `settings.py` now auto-selects SMTP unless `EMAIL_BACKEND` is explicitly set, and `manage.py check` emits `notifications.W001` if `console` is used with a real SMTP host.

---

## [0.8.1] — 2026-06-20

### Landing PageSpeed hardening — user-visible

**Доводка главной страницы по отчёту Lighthouse против `crm.prvms.ru`.**
- **Accessibility (контраст):** белый текст на зелёных кнопках `#43a047` давал контраст ≈3.0:1 (ниже WCAG AA 4.5:1). Зелёный для заливок с текстом в светлой теме затемнён: `--brand` `#43a047`→`#2e7d32` (белый текст 5.13:1), `--brand-strong` `#2e7d32`→`#1b5e20`. Декоративные галочки списков остаются свежо-зелёными.
- **Performance (Document request latency):** HTML-документ отдавался без сжатия. Добавлен `django.middleware.gzip.GZipMiddleware` (после `HealthCheckBypassMiddleware`); документ на проводе 100 469 → 37 266 байт, `content-encoding: gzip`.
- **SEO (robots.txt/sitemap.xml):** в проде `/robots.txt` ловил `prvms-spa` и отдавал HTML SPA. Добавлены `frontend/public/robots.txt`, `frontend/public/sitemap.xml` (Vite копирует `public/` в `dist/`, nginx отдаёт до SPA-фолбэка).
- **Agentic Browsing:** добавлен `frontend/public/llms.txt` с H1-заголовком и ссылками.
- **Брендинг:** официальный логотип-леттеринг `logo_text.png` встроен инлайн как WebP `<symbol>` (≈7.6/5.8 КБ светлый/тёмный варианты), переиспользуется через `<use>`; favicon обновлён с `logo.png`. Исходные PNG в репозиторий не коммитятся (`.gitignore`).

### Сквозной рефакторинг проекта (DEC-044) — internal

**Блок 0 (гигиена репозитория):** удалено постороннее дерево `frontend/src/composables/node_modules` (24 МБ); исторические спецификации `NEW_PROJECT_SPEC.md` и `MAX.md` перенесены в `docs/specs/`; удалён мёртвый легаси reverse-proxy (`nginx/` + `setup-ssl.sh`, замещённые Traefik в DEC-040); расписание celery beat уведено в `/tmp/celerybeat-schedule`.

**Блок 1 (наблюдаемость):** в `config/settings.py` добавлен словарь `LOGGING` с именованными доменными логгерами внешних интеграций (`apps.telephony`, `apps.integrations`, `apps.billing`, `apps.channels`, `apps.documents`, `apps.ai_assistant`); `disable_existing_loggers=False`; уровень управляется `LOG_LEVEL`/`DJANGO_LOG_LEVEL`.

**Блок 2 (статанализ ruff):** введён `pyproject.toml` с конфигом ruff (F/E/B/BLE/I), `requirements-dev.txt` с `ruff==0.15.18`, lint-job в CI как зависимость деплоя. 146 авто-исправлений (сортировка импортов, неиспользуемые импорты/переменные, f-строки без подстановок). Ручные корректностные правки: сужен `except Exception` → `except DisallowedHost` в `apps/core/tenant.py`; устранён **латентный `NameError`** в `apps/ai_assistant/consumers.py` (F821: `AIConversation`/`AIMessage` использовались без импорта); 6×B904 получили `raise … from exc`/`from None`; Hermes-скиллы получили логирование и `# noqa: BLE001`. E501 сознательно отложен на будущий проход `ruff format`.

**Блок 3 (декомпозиция Vue-views):** шесть крупных view приведены к паттерну «родитель владеет состоянием, дочерний — презентационный» (DEC-036). Вынесены `DealChatTab.vue`, `TemplateHtmlEditor.vue`, `DealsKanbanBoard.vue`, `ContactFormDialog.vue`, `ManagerEditDialog.vue`, `TriggerConfigDialog.vue`. View уменьшились с 3233 до 2778 строк. Удалён мёртвый код `KanbanBoard.vue` + `DealCard.vue`.

**Блок 4 (дедупликация seed + тесты):** триплицированная логика приведения `Membership` к каноническому состоянию вынесена в `apps/users/management/_seed_common.py::reconcile_membership`. Добавлены фронтенд-тесты `utils/datetime.test.ts` (6 новых кейсов; всего vitest 5→11).

**Блок 5 (документация):** синхронизированы устаревшие KNOWN_ISSUES #11 (CI существует) и #15 (`ContractsView` → `DocumentsView`); зафиксированы DEC-044, эта запись и строка TASK_STATE.

**Сопутствующее:** исправлен устаревший assertion в `apps/tenants/tests/test_tenant_resolver.py` (проверял absentную строку «CRM-платформа для продаж» и жёсткий `<html lang="ru">` после ребрендинга «ГусьБерри»).

**Validation:** `manage.py check` 0 issues; `makemigrations --check` без дрейфа; `ruff check .` чисто; **132/132** backend tests; frontend `typecheck` EXIT=0, `build` EXIT=0, `vitest` **11/11**; HTTP `/`→200, `/healthz`→200, `/app`→302, `/api/docs`→200, frontend `/`→200. Браузер-QA 6 декомпозированных экранов не выполнялся (нет браузера в среде) — KNOWN_ISSUES #17.

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-06-18

### Landing page redesigned under «ГусьБерри» brand — user-visible

**Complete rewrite of `templates/landing.html` to match `land_spec`.**
- Brand switched from «PRVMS CRM» to «ГусьБерри» — inline SVG goose mascot, text logo, neutral green favicon.
- Light theme: white background, neutral greys, accent `#43a047` only on buttons/links/highlights.
- Dark theme: `prefers-color-scheme` default + manual toggle with `localStorage['gb.theme']` persistence; anti-FOUC script in `<head>` sets `data-theme` before first paint.
- Structure follows `land_spec`: hero, target audience, system snapshot (deal card mockup), key differentiator, pricing tiers (Solo/Team/Business), 6-step onboarding flow, contact CTA with promo «до 1 июля».
- Pricing: values from `pricing_config.plans.*.price` rendered server-side (Solo 2990₽, Team 5990₽); Business — live calculator via `POST /api/public/pricing/quote/`.
- Contact form: `POST /api/public/pricing/telephony-request/` (name + email/phone + message in `configuration`, honeypot `website`, inline success/error states).
- SEO/Accessibility: correct title/description/canonical/OG/Twitter under «ГусьБерри», JSON-LD (Organization + WebSite + SoftwareApplication with Offers + FAQPage) without fake `aggregateRating`, semantic HTML5, skip-link, `aria-*`, `focus-visible`, `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Zero external resources: all CSS inline, all icons inline SVG, system font, zero image/font requests.

**Validation:** `manage.py check` 0 issues; `GET /` → HTTP 200, 55 KB, one file, zero external resources; `POST /api/public/pricing/quote/` → 200 with correct 7600₽ breakdown; `POST /api/public/pricing/telephony-request/` → 200 `{"status":"ok"}`; honeypot → 400. Visual QA and PageSpeed not performed (no browser in environment).

## [0.7.1] — 2026-06-18

### Рефакторинг модуля «Договоры» → «Документооборот» (DEC-043) — user-visible

**Полный rename `apps/contracts` → `apps/documents` без обратной совместимости.**
- `Contract` → `Document`, `ContractTemplate` → `DocumentTemplate`.
- Добавлен `DocumentType` (`contract`/`act`/`invoice`/`offer`/`addendum`/`other`). Тип хранится в `Document.document_type` и отображается в UI.
- Feature codes: `contracts` → `documents`, `contract_signing` → `document_signing`, `custom_contract_templates` → `custom_document_templates`. Лимит `max_contracts_per_month` → `max_documents_per_month`.
- Событие уведомлений `contract_signed` → `document_signed`; тип активности CRM `contract` → `document`; pipeline trigger `create_contract` → `create_document`.
- Backend: `apps/documents/` (models, api, admin, tasks, public views, pdf, signing, otp, esign_agreement, mapping, seed). Миграции пересозданы.
- Frontend: `/app/contracts` → `/app/documents`, `ContractsView.vue` → `DocumentsView.vue`, menu/router/dashboard/deal detail/subscription/register ссылки и лейблы приведены к «Документы».
- `docs/user-guide/07-contracts.md` → `07-documents.md`; обновлены `08-signing.md` и `README.md`.

### Billing hardening

- `apps/billing/api.py`, `catalog.py`, `tasks.py` — мелкие улучшения и исправления.
- `apps/billing/models.py` — дополнены модели и поля.
- `apps/billing/usage.py` — унифицирован `get_effective_limits()`.

### Cleanup

- Удалён `CLAUDE.md` (устаревшая документация с упоминаниями `apps.contracts`).
- Удалён `docs/PLAN_PRICING_CALCULATOR.md` (устаревший планировочный документ).
- Удалена директория `redesign/` (прототипы React/JSX, не используемые в production).
- Удалены мёртвые CSS-классы `.contract-row` из `DealsView.vue` и `DealDetailView.vue`.

**Validation:** `manage.py check` 0 issues; `makemigrations --check` без дрейфа; **76/76** backend tests; `npm run typecheck` EXIT=0; `npm run build` EXIT=0; **5/5** vitest; HTTP `/`, `/healthz`, `/app/documents` → 200.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-17

### Телефония MTS Exolve — полная замена FreeSWITCH (DEC-042) — user-visible

**FreeSWITCH удалён полностью.**
- Удалены сервис `freeswitch` из `docker-compose.yml`, файл `docker-compose.telephony.yml`, каталог `freeswitch/`, env-блок `FREESWITCH_*`/`SIP_BASE_DOMAIN`, ESL-код backend, sip.js и `useSIPPhone.ts`, публичные XML-эндпоинты (`dialplan/directory/events/configuration`). Зависимость `greenswitch` убрана из `requirements.txt`.

**Облако MTS Exolve — новый канал телефонии.**
- `apps/telephony/models.py` переписан: `ExolveChannel` (номер тенанта), `ExolveSIPAccount` (SIP-аккаунт менеджера, пароль в `EncryptedCharField`), `CallRecord` (провайдер-агностичный, ключ `call_sid`). Миграция `0003_exolve` удаляет legacy-модели (`SIPTrunk`, `PhoneExtension`, `IVRMenu`, `CallQueue`) и создаёт новые.
- `apps/telephony/exolve_client.py` — HTTP-клиент Numbering API (`GetFree`, `Lock`, `Buy`) и SIP API (`Create`, `GetAttributes`, `SetDisplayNumber`) с полным логированием.
- `apps/telephony/exolve_service.py` — провижининг номера (Lock → Buy → SetCallForwarding), авто-creation SIP-аккаунтов, резолв тенанта по номеру, контроль дублей сделок (`stage_type='open'`), формирование `followme_struct` для IPCR.
- `apps/telephony/public_views.py` — `exolve_ipcr` (JSON-RPC `getControlCallFollowMe`) и `exolve_events` (Call Events `b/o/s/h/d/e/crr`) с защитой `EXOLVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
- `apps/telephony/tasks.py` — `process_exolve_event` (журналирование звонка) + `download_call_record` (фоновое скачивание записи по Bearer).
- `apps/telephony/api.py` — endpoint-ы: `channel`, `number-reference`, `available-numbers`, `connect-number`, `sip-accounts` (+ provision), `webrtc-credentials`, `click-to-call`, `calls`, `stats`.
- `apps/tenants/models.py` — shared-модель `ExolveNumberLookup` (резолв тенанта по номеру), миграция `0006_exolve_number_lookup`. Паттерн `SigningTokenLookup`.

**Frontend.**
- `frontend/src/stores/phone.ts` — Pinia-store для Web Voice SDK (`@mts-exolve/web-voice-sdk`): регистрация, входящий/исходящий, состояние звонка, аудио.
- `frontend/src/components/SoftPhone.vue` — глобальный софтфон, встроен в `App.vue`; входящий pop-up, кнопки ответа/завершения, статус.
- `frontend/src/components/ExolveNumberWizard.vue` — мастер подключения номера: выбор из списка доступных, автоматическая бронь/покупка/настройка переадресации.
- Переписан `frontend/src/views/TelephonyView.vue` — упрощённый UI под Exolve: номер тенанта, SIP-аккаунты, журнал звонков, запись.
- `frontend/src/api/telephony.ts` — обновлён под новые endpoint-ы Exolve.
- Кнопки «Позвонить» добавлены в `ContactsView.vue` и `DealDetailView.vue`.
- `frontend/package.json`: удалён `sip.js`, добавлен `@mts-exolve/web-voice-sdk@^1.1.4`.

**Тесты.**
- Старые телефонные тесты (`test_api.py`, `test_public_endpoints.py`, `test_services.py`, `test_tasks.py`) удалены.
- Новый `apps/telephony/tests/test_exolve.py` — 5 тестов: IPCR-дедуп сделки, маршрутизация на ответственного, неизвестный номер (пустой `followme_struct`), обработка Call Events, загрузка записи.
- `apps/crm/tests/test_dashboard_api.py` — адаптирован под новую `CallRecord` (поле `call_sid` вместо `freeswitch_uuid`).

**Прочее.**
- `config/settings.py` — блок `EXOLVE_*` (`EXOLVE_API_KEY`, `EXOLVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `EXOLVE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`).
- `.env.example` и `.env.prod.example` — обновлены под новые переменные.
- `apps/telephony/admin.py` — зарегистрированы `ExolveChannel`, `ExolveSIPAccount`, `CallRecord`.
- `apps/billing/migrations/0008_align_plan_features.py` — синхронизация полей `Plan` с v2-тарифами (telephony-флаги).

**Validation:** `manage.py check` 0 issues; `makemigrations --check` без дрейфа; **131/131** backend tests; `npm run typecheck` EXIT=0; `npm run build` EXIT=0; **5/5** vitest; рендер `/healthz`, `/`, `/app` → 200; публичные webhook-и отвечают корректно. Реальный голосовой звонок требует боевого ключа Exolve и прода — см. KNOWN_ISSUES #23–25.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-02

### Pricing v2 — Custom Plan Configurator (user-visible)

**New tariff lineup: СОЛО, КОМАНДА, СВОБОДНЫЙ.**
- Legacy plans (`simple`/`basic`/`crm`) deactivated and replaced with three new plans:
  - **СОЛО** — 1 user, Telegram + VK + email, 1 inbound channel, 100 documents/month, 20 signatures/month, 2 990 ₽/month.
  - **КОМАНДА** — 5 users, +MAX messenger, site/VK/Avito inbound, telephony (1 number, 5 lines, 1000 min), 1000 documents/month, 100 signatures/month, distribution, 5 990 ₽/month.
  - **СВОБОДНЫЙ** — fully configurable tariff: pay only for what you use (users, messengers, inbound channels, documents, signatures). Telephony available on request.

**Interactive pricing calculator on the landing page.**
- Inline calculator in `templates/landing.html`: adjust number of users, select messengers (Telegram, VK, MAX, WhatsApp), inbound channels (site widget, VK, Avito, email), documents and signatures per month.
- Real-time total calculation with per-unit breakdown. Configurator prices driven by `settings.PRICING_CUSTOM` (unit prices in RUB).
- "Calculate tariff" button reveals the calculator; CTA buttons on each pricing card link directly to `/register?plan=<slug>`.

**Public API for quotes and telephony requests.**
- `POST /api/public/pricing/quote/` — creates a `PricingQuote` (UUID, 24h TTL) from calculator configuration. Returns `monthly_total`, `breakdown`, `telephony_requires_quote`, `quote_id`.
- `POST /api/public/pricing/telephony-request/` — creates a `TelephonyQuoteRequest`. Honeypot (`website` field) and IP-based rate limiting (1 req/min via Django cache). Sends async email to support via Celery.

**Registration flow supports custom-plan quotes.**
- `RegisterIn` schema extended with `quote_id` (optional UUID string).
- When `plan_slug='free-custom'` and `quote_id` is provided, backend validates the quote (exists, not expired) and stores calculated limits in `Tenant.custom_limits` JSONField.
- `RegisterView.vue` reads `?plan=` and `?quote_id=` query params on mount, pre-selects the plan, and passes `quote_id` in the registration payload.

**Models and migrations.**
- `Plan` extended with v2 fields: `description`, `max_messengers`, `max_inbound_channels`, `max_signatures_per_month`, `telephony_included`, `max_phone_numbers`, `max_phone_lines`, `included_minutes`, `kind` (`preset`/`custom`).
- New `PricingQuote` model: UUID PK, `created_at`, `expires_at`, `config` (JSON), `monthly_total`, `telephony_requires_quote`.
- New `TelephonyQuoteRequest` model: `name`, `email`, `phone`, `config_json`, `status` (`new`/`contacted`/`closed`).
- New `Tenant.custom_limits` JSONField for storing effective limits of a custom-plan tenant.
- Migrations: `0005_plan_pricing_v2`, `0006_seed_plans_solo_komanda`, `0007_migrate_tenants_to_v2_plans`.
- Data migration safely maps old plans to new ones: `simple→solo`, `basic→komanda`, `crm→free-custom`. Preserves legacy pricing info for tenants with active paid subscriptions.

**Usage and limits.**
- `apps/billing/usage.py`: `LIMIT_KEYS` maps usage keys to plan attributes; `get_effective_limits()` returns `tenant.custom_limits` for custom plans, otherwise plan fields.
- Usage tracking expanded with `messengers` (active `MessengerChannel` count), `inbound_channels` (placeholder 0), `signatures` (placeholder 0).

**Admin.**
- `PlanAdmin` updated; `TelephonyQuoteRequestAdmin` registered with list/filter/search.

**Tests.**
- `apps/billing/tests/test_pricing_calculator.py`: 10 tests covering quote calculation (basic, zero messengers, telephony flag, document boundary blocks), 24h TTL, telephony request success/honeypot/rate-limit/missing-contact, and registration with valid/expired quote.
- All existing billing/tenant/user tests updated for new plan slugs (`solo`/`komanda`/`free-custom`).

**Validation:** `manage.py check` 0 issues; **49/49** targeted backend tests (billing + tenants + users); `npm run typecheck` EXIT=0; `npm run build` EXIT=0 (730 modules); **5/5** vitest; `curl /api/public/pricing/quote/` → 200; `curl /` → 200 landing page.

## [0.5.2] — 2026-06-01

### Fixed (Traefik routing — discovered during first production deploy)

- `prvms-api` router rule extended with `Path(\`/\`)` so the root `/` is served by Django (SEO landing page, DEC-038) instead of falling through to the SPA catch-all.
- `frontend-app` healthcheck removed entirely. Traefik 2.x intentionally skips routers for containers in `starting`/`unhealthy` state; busybox-wget probes on `localhost` are flaky (IPv6/IPv4 resolution mismatch), so the container stayed in `starting` and the SPA/static routers never registered → 404 on all requests. Without a healthcheck Traefik treats the container as healthy immediately; Docker restart policy handles actual nginx crashes.
- `migrate` service now runs `collectstatic` so Django static files are gathered into the shared `static_volume` before `frontend-app` starts (previously `/static/` 404 on first request).
- `env_file` in compose fixed from `.env.prod` to `.env` (aligns with `deploy.sh` which expects `.env`).

**Validation:** `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml config` renders cleanly; `./deploy.sh` passes validation and brings up all services.

---

## [0.5.1] — 2026-06-01

### Infrastructure — production deployment now uses shared Traefik reverse proxy

**Removed nginx from production stack.**
- `docker-compose.prod.yml`: `nginx` service removed entirely. Ports 80/443 are no longer exposed on the host; all external traffic is routed through the shared Traefik instance.
- `web` service: added Traefik labels (`traefik.enable=true`, `traefik.docker.network=traefik`, `traefik.http.routers.prvms-api.rule`, entrypoints `websecure`, TLS via `letsencrypt`, priority 100). Reaches port 8000.
- `frontend-app` service: added Traefik labels for two routers:
  - `prvms-static` — `PathPrefix(/static)` (priority 50) for Django collected static files.
  - `prvms-spa` — catch-all `Host` rule (priority 1) for the Vue SPA, reaching port 80.
- `web` and `frontend-app` joined the external Docker network `traefik` (`external: true`). `backend` network remains `internal: true` for db/redis/workers.

**Explicit image tags to prevent implicit-pull failures.**
- `web` → `image: prvms-crm-web:latest` (also serves as the build target).
- `migrate`, `celery`, `celery-beat` → `image: prvms-crm-web:latest` (reuse the same locally-built image; no separate build blocks).
- `frontend-app` → `image: prvms-crm-frontend:latest`.

**Environment template updated.**
- `.env.prod.example`: removed `NGINX_SERVER_NAME`, `NGINX_SSL_CERT_PATH`, `NGINX_SSL_KEY_PATH` (legacy nginx variables). Added `TRAEFIK_HOST` (domain routed by Traefik into this project).

**Deploy script updated.**
- `deploy.sh`: removed `check_ssl_files()` and all nginx references (waiting for nginx, nginx logs, `NGINX_SERVER_NAME` in required keys).
- Added `check_traefik()`: validates that Docker network `traefik` exists and container `traefik` is running; fails fast with a clear error before any build/migrate steps.
- `wait_for_services` now waits for `web` + `frontend-app` instead of `web` + `nginx`.
- Failure diagnostics show logs for `web`, `frontend-app`, `db` — no nginx.

**Cleanup of obsolete deployment artefacts.**
- Removed `for_sample_deploy/` (bootstrap-server.sh, deploy.sh, docker-compose.prod.yml, setup-ssl.sh) — superseded by the Traefik-based flow.
- Removed `vps-deployment/` subtree (bookstack, druzhina, kapitan_api, kupi_slona, portainer, rent_django, traefik, vybra, scripts, systemd, docs) — these were separate-project configs that leaked into this repo and are no longer maintained here.

**Validation:** `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml config` renders cleanly with `TRAEFIK_HOST` interpolation.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-30

### VKontakte Messenger Channel (DEC-039) — user-visible

**New channel: ВКонтакте community messages.**
- Users connect VK communities via one-click OAuth (standalone app on vk.com/dev).
- Only personal messages to the community are processed; comments, likes, lead forms, mentions are ignored.
- Incoming messages create `ChatSession` + `MessageLog` and trigger `auto_create_lead` (same pipeline as Telegram/MAX).
- Operator replies from CRM are delivered back to the client in VK via `messages.send`.

**OAuth flow (frontend-driven Implicit Flow).**
- `POST /api/channels/oauth/vk/start/` — returns `authorize_url` with signed `state` (Django `signing.dumps`, TTL 1h).
- Browser redirects to `oauth.vk.com/authorize` with `response_type=token`.
- `GET /oauth/vk/callback` (SPA route, no auth guard) parses `window.location.hash`, extracts `access_token_<group_id>` pairs, POSTs them to backend.
- `POST /api/channels/oauth/vk/complete/` — verifies state/tenant, fetches group info via `groups.getById`, creates `MessengerChannel`, auto-registers Callback API webhook.
- Per-group creation: if one group fails, others still proceed; response lists `created` and `failed`.

**Callback API auto-registration.**
- `groups.getCallbackConfirmationCode` → saved in `credentials.confirmation_code`.
- Generated `secret_key` (`secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`) saved in credentials.
- `groups.addCallbackServer` → `server_id` saved.
- `groups.setCallbackSettings(message_new=1)` — only `message_new` enabled.
- Rollback on failure: channel deleted, VK token left to expire (no orphan server).

**Webhook handler.**
- `POST /channels/webhook/<tenant_slug>/vk/<channel_id>/`
- `type=confirmation` → plain-text response with `confirmation_code`.
- All other events verify `payload.secret` against `credentials.secret_key`.
- `type=message_new` is routed to Celery `route_incoming_message`; everything else is ignored.

**Provider functions (`apps/channels/providers.py`).**
- `get_vk_group_info` — `groups.getById` (name + photo).
- `register_vk_callback` — 4-step registration (confirmation code → secret → add server → settings).
- `unregister_vk_callback` — `groups.deleteCallbackServer`.
- `normalize_incoming_payload` for `vk` — extracts `peer_id`, `text`, `id`, `attachments`; ignores `confirmation`/`wall_reply`/etc.
- `send_outgoing` for `vk` — `messages.send` with `random_id=secrets.randbits(31)`, `v=5.199`.

**Settings.**
- `VK_APP_ID` env variable (platform-wide standalone app ID).
- `VK_API_VERSION = '5.199'` constant.
- `.env.example` updated with placeholder + comment linking to `docs/user-guide/admin/vk-app-setup.md`.

**Frontend.**
- `frontend/src/views/oauth/VkCallbackView.vue` — callback page (spinner, error, success with created/failed list, auto-redirect after 2.5s).
- `frontend/src/api/channels.ts` — `startVkOauth()`, `completeVkOauth()`.
- `frontend/src/router/index.ts` — public route `/oauth/vk/callback`.
- `ChannelsView.vue` — «Подключить ВКонтакте» button (icon + handler storing state in `sessionStorage`).
- `ChannelsTab.vue` — VK icon (`assets/icons/vk.svg`) shown next to channel type label.

**Tests.**
- `test_vk_provider.py` — 7 tests (normalize message_new, ignore confirmation/wall_reply, attachments, send success/error, register full flow, unregister, get_group_info error).
- `test_vk_webhook.py` — 4 tests (confirmation returns code, message_new with correct secret, wrong secret → 403, missing channel → 404).
- `test_vk_oauth_api.py` — 6 tests (start returns URL/state, requires admin, complete creates channels, invalid state → 400, tenant mismatch → 400, partial failure handled).
- All existing channels tests remain green: **33/33 OK**.

**Documentation.**
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — DEC-039 (Standalone OAuth + Callback API, invariants, alternatives).
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — user-facing announcement (russian).
- `docs/DEV_LOG.md` — full implementation log with file list, validation, risks.
- `docs/TASK_STATE.md` — task #32 marked done.
- `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` — VK v1 limitations (no user names, no outgoing attachments, stickers as metadata only).
- `docs/user-guide/vk-channel.md` — 3-step user guide, FAQ on community access.
- `docs/user-guide/admin/vk-app-setup.md` — platform admin setup instructions.

**Validation:** `manage.py check` 0 issues; **33/33** backend tests; `npm run typecheck` EXIT=0; `npm run build` EXIT=0; **5/5** vitest.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-18

### SEO Landing Page (DEC-038) — user-visible

**Django-rendered landing page at root `/` replaces SPA redirect.**
- New `templates/landing.html` — fully self-contained HTML with inline CSS (~6 KB), system fonts, inline SVG icons, zero external image/font requests.
- SEO: `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, `canonical`, `robots index,follow`, Open Graph (title/description/type/url/locale `ru_RU`), Twitter Cards (`summary_large_image`).
- Structured data: JSON-LD `@graph` with 4 entities — `Organization`, `WebSite`, `SoftwareApplication` (with `AggregateRating` and `Offer`), `FAQPage` (3 Q/A pairs).
- Accessibility: `lang="ru"`, skip-link, semantic roles (`banner`/`main`/`contentinfo`), `aria-label` for nav, `focus-visible` outlines, touch targets ≥44 px, `prefers-reduced-motion` guard.
- Responsive: CSS Grid `auto-fit`/`minmax`, `@media (max-width: 480px)` for padding/hero, flex-wrap in header/actions.
- Sections: Hero (gradient + dual CTA), Features (6 cards: CRM, Contracts, Telephony, Messengers, Analytics, AI Assistant), How it works (3 steps), Pricing (Simple/Basic/CRM), CTA banner, Footer.

**Backend & routing.**
- `config/views.py`: new `landing_page()` renders `landing.html` with `canonical_url` built from `PLATFORM_PROTOCOL` + `PLATFORM_DOMAIN`.
- `config/urls.py`: `path('', landing_page)` — root now serves HTML instead of redirecting to SPA.
- `vps-deployment/crm_prvms/docker-compose.yml`: Traefik `crm-api` router extended with `Path(\`/\`)` (priority 100) so production routes root to backend, not frontend-app.
- Backward compatibility: `/login`, `/register`, `/app/*` still redirect to SPA (dev) or route through `crm-spa` (production). `LandingView.vue` remains as dev Vite fallback.

**Tests.**
- `apps/tenants/tests/test_tenant_resolver.py`: `test_root_endpoint_renders_landing_page` verifies 200 + `text/html` + H1 + `lang="ru"`. Replaces old redirect test.

**Files:**
- **New:** `templates/landing.html`
- **Changed:** `config/views.py`, `config/urls.py`, `apps/tenants/tests/test_tenant_resolver.py`, `vps-deployment/crm_prvms/docker-compose.yml`

**Validation:** `manage.py check` 0 issues; **129/129** backend tests; `npm run typecheck` EXIT=0; `npm run build` EXIT=0; **5/5** vitest; `curl /` → 200 text/html with JSON-LD; `curl /login` → 302 to SPA.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-17

### Navigation & Deal UX Restructure (DEC-038) — user-visible

**Deal Detail as a standalone page with chat inside.**
- New `DealDetailView.vue` at `/app/deals/:id`. Replaces the modal dialog in `DealsView`.
- Three tabs: **Info** (editable fields, contracts list), **Activity** (timeline + add note), **Chat** (channel selector, message history, real-time WS, reply input).
- Clicking a deal in Kanban or list navigates to the detail page; the URL contains the deal id (shareable link).
- Chat tab shows `chat_sessions` linked to the deal via `CrmDealChatSessionRef`; channel switcher loads messages per session; optimistic outgoing messages; WS deduplication via temp-id replacement; auto-scroll.

**Contact Drawer — linked deals tab.**
- New "Deals" tab in `ContactDrawer` lists all deals linked to the contact via `contactDeals(id)` (`listDeals({ contact_id })`).
- Clicking a deal navigates to `/app/deals/:id`.

**Menu restructure.**
- **Companies** added as a top-level sidebar item (`/app/companies`).
- **Chats** (`/app/chats`) replaces "Messengers" in the sidebar; `ChatsView.vue` shows only chat sessions (no channel settings).
- **Messengers** (channel CRUD) moved into **Settings** as the "Messengers" tab (`ChannelsView` embedded in `SettingsView`).
- **Distribution** moved into **Team** as the "Distribution" tab (`DistributionView` embedded in `TeamView`). Old `/app/distribution` redirects to `/app/team?tab=distribution`.
- **Notifications** moved into **Settings** as the "Notifications" tab (`NotificationsView` embedded in `SettingsView`). Old `/app/notifications` redirects to `/app/settings?tab=notifications`.
- **Integrations** sidebar item marked `locked: true` (inactive until feature launch).
- `SettingsView` access expanded from `owner` only to `owner` + `admin` (router meta).

**Help documentation — production build fix.**
- `Dockerfile.frontend` now copies `docs/user-guide` into the build context so bundled markdown articles are available in the production image. Dev environment already worked via volume mount.

**Files:**
- **New:** `frontend/src/views/DealDetailView.vue`, `frontend/src/views/ChatsView.vue`
- **Changed:** `frontend/src/router/index.ts`, `frontend/src/layout/AppMenu.vue`, `frontend/src/views/DealsView.vue`, `frontend/src/components/ContactDrawer.vue`, `frontend/src/views/TeamView.vue`, `frontend/src/views/SettingsView.vue`, `frontend/src/api/crm.ts`, `Dockerfile.frontend`

**Validation:** `manage.py check` 0 issues; **129/129** backend tests; `npm run typecheck` EXIT=0; `npm run build` EXIT=0; **5/5** vitest; SPA routes (`/app/deals/1`, `/app/chats`, `/app/settings`, `/app/help`) → 200.

### Fixed
- `apps/users/auth_api.py`: `SameSite='None'` without `Secure` blocked auth in dev. Fixed: `samesite='Lax' if DEBUG else 'None'`. (Hotfix from previous session, included in this release.)

---

## [0.2.6] — 2026-05-16

### Mobile UI adaptation (DEC-037) — user-visible

Root cause of "mobile sidebar won't hide" was a **CSS-specificity bug**, not JS: the desktop rule `.layout-static .layout-sidebar` (specificity 0,2,0) always beat the mobile media-query rule `.layout-sidebar` (0,1,0) — media queries add no specificity and the container always carries `.layout-static`. The sidebar stayed permanently visible on phones.

- **Structural layout fix:** desktop static/overlay modes moved under `@media (min-width: 992px)`, mobile off-canvas drawer + mask under `@media (max-width: 991px)` — mutually-exclusive ranges remove the specificity collision structurally (no `!important` patch). JS (`useLayout`, `AppSidebar` route watcher) unchanged — it was already correct.
- **Single-source responsive layer in `styles/main.css`:** `.form-grid/.form-row-2/.form-row-3` are now global primitives that collapse to one column ≤640px (scoped duplicates removed from 6 files so the global rule is not shadowed by `[data-v-*]` specificity); `.section-header` wraps ≤640px; `.p-dialog`/`.p-drawer` capped at `max-width: 95vw` globally (one place vs 12 per-dialog widths); topbar shrinks on ≤991px, wordmark hidden ≤480px.
- **Card-mode tables:** new `v-responsive-table` directive tags the table root `.rt-cards` and copies each column header into `td[data-label]`; ≤767px every row becomes a labelled card, the empty/`colspan` row stays a single block. Selectors are PrimeVue-class-agnostic (semantic `thead/tbody/tr/td`) and verified against PrimeVue 4.4 source. Applied to all 24 `PDataTable`.
- **Per-view:** `tasks-layout`/`assistant-layout` collapse to one column ≤768px; `.tabs-bar`/`.tab-bar` (Contracts/Team/Pipelines) wrap.

Validation: `manage.py check` 0 issues; `npm run typecheck` EXIT=0; `npm run build` EXIT=0; **5/5** vitest; bundle contains `rt-cards`/`min-width:992px`/`max-width:991px`/`data-label`; dev SPA `/app` → 200. Browser QA on a real device not run in this environment (no browser) — KNOWN_ISSUES #17.

### Refactor (P0–P2, DEC-036) — behaviour-preserving, no user-visible change

Decomposition of monolithic modules following the DEC-032 pattern (sibling modules + thin back-compat shim). All public imports keep working unchanged.

**Backend.**
- `apps/crm/api.py` 864 LOC → 23-line shim + `_api_common` + `schemas` + domain modules `contacts_api`/`companies_api`/`pipelines_api`/`deals_api`/`activities_api`/`stats_api`.
- `apps/integrations/api.py` 705 LOC → shim + `connections_api`/`webhooks_api`/`oauth_api` (`_api_common` for router/schemas/request-coupled helpers; `services.py` stays request-agnostic).
- `apps/contracts/services.py` 558 LOC → shim + `mapping`/`pdf`/`otp`/`esign_agreement`/`signing` (acyclic import graph). `test_signing_flow` OTP patch targets repointed to `apps.contracts.signing.*` (behavioural assertions unchanged).
- All CRM `XIn`/`XPatchIn` schemas centralised in `apps/crm/schemas.py`.

**Frontend.**
- Restored the DEC-032 “0 `as any`” invariant: `CrmDeal` completed (`created_at`/`expected_close_date`/`loss_reason`); SIP.js boundary typed via `Web.SessionDescriptionHandler`.
- `useApiCall` composable — single enforcement point for the DEC-031 error-toast invariant; `DealsView` fully migrated.
- View decomposition (pattern: parent owns state/WS/loading, child is presentational, reactive form objects passed by reference, actions via emits):
  - `DealsView` 760→623 — `QuickContactDialog`, `QuickCompanyDialog`, `DealFormDialog`, `DealDetailDialog`.
  - `IntegrationsView` 645→415 — `IntegrationSetupCard`, `ConnectionsTable`, `IntegrationErrorsDialog`.
  - `ChannelsView` 605→452 — `ChannelsTab` and `ChatsTab` (WS lifecycle stays in the parent; `ChatsTab` owns only the scroll DOM node and exposes `scrollToBottom()` so the parent's WS/send/load handlers keep deciding *when* to scroll — a 1:1 control-flow-preserving relocation).

**Validation gate** strengthened with a real `vite build` (full `.vue` compilation + component prop/import resolution) in addition to `vue-tsc --noEmit`.

Validation: `manage.py check` clean; **128/128** backend tests; targeted crm/integrations/contracts 24/24; `npm run typecheck` EXIT=0; `npm run build` EXIT=0 (706 modules); **5/5** vitest.

## [0.2.5] — 2026-05-13

### Fixed (Messenger channels)

Messenger pipeline rewrite — four independent bugs fixed in a single pass:

**`normalize_incoming_payload` returns `None` for unsupported update types.**
Previously, a Telegram `edited_message` update would fall through to `payload.get('message') or payload`, returning the whole Update object and producing `chat_id='unknown'`. Incoming messages from the same user would either be lost or merged into a single session. MAX `bot_started` events created ghost sessions with `chat_id='unknown'`. Now: Telegram `edited_message` is correctly routed to the session; `callback_query`, `inline_query` and other unsupported types return `None` and are ignored. MAX `bot_started` returns `None` and is ignored.

**`register_telegram_webhook` now requests `edited_message` updates.**
`allowed_updates` expanded from `['message']` to `['message', 'edited_message']`.

**Explicit pipeline/stage lookup with user-visible failure.**
`_find_pipeline_and_stage()` logs a warning when no pipeline or no stage is found. `_auto_create_lead()` writes `message.error = 'Воронка или этап не настроены — сделка не создана'` and sets `delivered=False` so ops can see the exact cause in the UI instead of a silent missing deal.

**Bare `except Exception` replaced with typed handlers.**
All `providers.py` functions (and outbound path in `tasks.py`) now use `requests.RequestException` instead of a bare `except`, so network failures, HTTP errors and timeouts are properly distinguished from programming errors.

### Refactored

- `apps/channels/tasks.py`: three helper functions extracted — `_find_pipeline_and_stage()`, `_build_contact()`, `_auto_create_lead()`, `_sync_to_external_crm()`. Source length unchanged but logical units are now independently testable.
- `apps/channels/tests/test_bridge.py`: coverage expanded from 3 to 13 tests covering normal message, edited message, unsupported updates (Telegram and MAX), missing pipeline, missing stage, `auto_create_lead=False`, and external CRM sync.
- `apps/channels/public_views.py`: structured `logger.info`/`logger.warning` added at every webhook entry/exit point.

### Infrastructure

- `vps-deployment/crm_prvms/docker-compose.yml`: Redis `command` rewritten from YAML block scalar (`>`) to JSON array to fix argument parsing bug that produced `requirepass "--maxmemory" "256mb"`.

## [0.2.4] — 2026-05-11

### Added (CI/CD via GitHub Actions)

End-to-end pipeline in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml). Single file, three jobs:

- **backend** — runs on every PR and push. Spins up Postgres 17 + Redis 7.4 as service containers, installs system deps for WeasyPrint/psycopg, then: `manage.py check`, `makemigrations --check --dry-run` (catches the latent-debt class of bug that 0.2.3 cleaned up — any future model drift fails CI), `manage.py test apps`. Python pinned to 3.13 to match the production Dockerfile.
- **frontend** — Node 24, `npm ci`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test` (vitest), `npm run build` with `VITE_API_URL=https://crm.prvms.ru/api` to verify the prod bundle compiles.
- **deploy** — runs only on push to `main` after both CI jobs pass. SSH-deploys to the VPS using the existing `vps-deployment/crm_prvms/deploy.sh`. Singleton concurrency group `production-deploy` so two deploys can never overlap; `cancel-in-progress: false` so a newer commit never aborts an in-flight deploy. Smoke tests `/healthz` (12 attempts × 10s = 2 min) and `/` (homepage) after deploy. GitHub environment `production` declared so an approval gate can be enabled later without code changes.

[`.github/SECRETS.md`](.github/SECRETS.md) documents the three secrets needed (`SSH_HOST`, `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, `SSH_PORT`), one-time server-side SSH-key setup, branch-protection rules to prevent direct push to `main`, and the optional approval gate.

### Notes
- CI uses dummy values for `SECRET_KEY` / `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` / `SALT_KEY` baked into the workflow — there are no real secrets in CI runs. Production secrets stay on the VPS in `/opt/crm_prvms/.env.prod`.
- Deploy step uses `git reset --hard ${DEPLOY_SHA}` so CI is the single source of truth for what `main` looks like on the server. Untracked `.env.prod` is preserved by `reset --hard` (it does not touch untracked files).

## [0.2.3] — 2026-05-11

### Migrations

`deploy.sh` log on production surfaced silent latent debt — two apps had model code that diverged from the last migration. Existing migrations applied fine, but `makemigrations --check` would have failed and any future `makemigrations` run would have created these implicitly. Generated, applied to local DB (`migrate_schemas --shared` and `--tenant`), verified `--check` is clean:

- `apps/distribution/migrations/0003_distribution_choices_sync.py` — sync `DistributionLog.source` choices (adds `builtin_crm`) and `DistributionRule.trigger` choices (`new_deal` canonical) with what's been in the model code since DEC-030. Choices-only, no schema change beyond the CHECK constraint refresh.
- `apps/users/migrations/0003_rolepermission_index_names.py` — rename two indexes on `RolePermission` whose autogenerated hash suffix drifted after a field-options change. Pure metadata, `ALTER INDEX RENAME`.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-05-11

### Fixed (DEC-034 addendum: production HTTPS — three remaining failure modes)

After `0.2.1` was deployed the homepage on `crm.prvms.ru` still returned 404. Debug-level Traefik logs revealed three structural issues that survived `0.2.1`:

**`/opt/crm_prvms/docker-compose.yml` was a stale copy, not a symlink.** At initial server setup the file got copied instead of `ln -sf`'d to `vps-deployment/crm_prvms/docker-compose.yml`. Every subsequent `git pull` updated the source file but `docker compose up` kept consuming the frozen copy — so the `0.2.1` healthcheck fix never reached the running container.

**`frontend-app` healthcheck removed entirely.** Fighting busybox-`wget` over `localhost` / `::1` / `127.0.0.1` / PATH inside `nginx:alpine` is a losing battle for a static-file container. Any resolution or wget-variant quirk makes the container `unhealthy` and Traefik filters its routers. nginx serving an SPA is reliable; if it dies, Docker's restart policy handles it. Traefik v2 treats containers without a healthcheck as healthy and registers their routers immediately.

**`bring_up()` now uses `--force-recreate`.** Without it, `docker compose up -d` may decide the image hash is unchanged and skip container recreation, leaving the previous compose-level config (healthcheck command, labels) in place. Force-recreate guarantees compose-level changes actually propagate.

### Added

- **`/VERSION`** — single source of truth for the project version (was implicit in `docs/VERSIONING.md` text). [`docs/VERSIONING.md`](docs/VERSIONING.md) now describes the bump-checklist and points to `/VERSION`.
- **`vps-deployment/crm_prvms/deploy.sh`**: `ensure_root_layout()` idempotently rewrites `/opt/crm_prvms/{docker-compose.yml,deploy.sh,.env.prod.example}` as symlinks to `vps-deployment/crm_prvms/*` on every run. Any pre-existing regular file is backed up to `<file>.copy_replaced_<unix-ts>.bak`. Makes the copy-vs-symlink class of bug structurally impossible.
- **`vps-deployment/scripts/start-all.sh`**: mirror `ensure_crm_root_symlinks()` in `prepare_project_env`, so first-time setup or drift gets repaired on the next `start-all.sh` run too.

### Changed

- `web` healthcheck rewritten to use `127.0.0.1` literal instead of `localhost`. Marginal — `curl` does IPv4 fallback — but removes the extra RTT and makes behavior deterministic.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-11

### Fixed (DEC-034: HTTPS root cause)
- **`/healthz` returns 200 regardless of Host header.** New `HealthCheckBypassMiddleware` placed first in `MIDDLEWARE`, before `django_tenants.TenantMainMiddleware`. Liveness probes from container orchestrators (Docker healthcheck, k8s, Traefik) no longer depend on `Domain`/`Tenant` state.
  - Root cause: `TenantMainMiddleware` ran before URL resolution and returned 404 for `Host: localhost`/`127.0.0.1` since no matching `Domain` row exists in shared schema. Docker healthcheck hit `curl http://localhost:8000/healthz` → 404 → container marked unhealthy → Traefik 2.x silently filtered out the routers → Let's Encrypt never issued a certificate.
- **`frontend-app` healthcheck uses IPv4 literal `127.0.0.1`.** Busybox-`wget` in `nginx:alpine` resolves `localhost` to `::1` first and does not fall back to IPv4; nginx listens IPv4-only here.

### Added
- `vps-deployment/scripts/start-all.sh`: preflight in `check_build_prereqs` — `crm_prvms` refuses to start without `PUBLIC_HOSTNAME` in `.env.prod`. Prevents the silent `Host(``)` Traefik-label scenario.

### Security
- `.gitignore`: removed the blanket `/vps-deployment` rule (was hiding new tracked files); added narrow patterns for secrets only (`vps-deployment/**/.env*`, `acme.json`, `logs/`, `media/`); generalized `.venv/` → `.venv*`.
- Removed `vps-deployment/crm_prvms/.venv.current_on_server` — a snapshot of production `.env.prod` containing real `SECRET_KEY`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`, `HERMES_API_KEY`, `OPENCODE_API_TOKEN`. File was untracked locally but lived in the working tree. **Rotate exposed keys.**

### Closed Issues
- KNOWN_ISSUES #12: `crm.prvms.ru` Let's Encrypt certificate finally issuable; previously masked by two independent unhealthy-container conditions and a missing `PUBLIC_HOSTNAME` in server env. DEC-033 (Traefik restart on deploy) retained as defensive measure.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-10

### Refactoring (DEC-032: Full A-E)
- **AI Assistant**: removed redundant `tenant` FK from `AIConversation` (lives in tenant schema); renamed `herMes_conversation_id` → `hermes_conversation_id`; regenerated migration; removed duplicate test suite.
- **Vite dev**: `working_dir` changed from `/app` to `/srv/app` — fixes 500 EISDIR on SPA route `/app`.
- **Frontend types**: `CrmContact` expanded with `position/messenger_id/source/esign_agreement_*`; `CrmDeal` got `contracts/chat_sessions/source` refs; `IvrMenu.options` strictly typed; all 12 `(x as any)` casts eliminated; `tsconfig.json` added `skipLibCheck: true`.
- **Backend API split**: `apps/users/api.py` (769 LOC) → shim (18 LOC) + `auth_api.py` (login/register/refresh/logout/me/orgs/switch/invite) + `team_api.py` (members/invite/role/permissions) + `managers_api.py` (manager-profiles/days-off).
- **Tenant provisioning**: new `apps/tenants/services.py` with `provision_tenant()` and `ensure_default_pipeline()` — single public entry point replacing private cross-app imports.
- **Frontend decomposition**: `CRMView.vue` (2023 LOC) removed; new `CompaniesView` (167 LOC), `PipelinesView` (480 LOC), `StatsView` (135 LOC); `/app/crm` redirects to `/app/deals`; sidebar updated with new items.
- **Frontend logger**: `utils/logger.ts` with scoped `debug/info/warn/error` — `debug`/`info` silent in production; replaced `console.log` in stores and views.
- **Bare except**: 23 broad `except Exception:` narrowed to `TokenError`, `DoesNotExist`, `RequestException`, `OSError`, `JSONDecodeError`; remaining broad excepts in `telephony/tasks.py` justified with explicit comment (greenswitch library).

### Fixed (DEC-030: Functional Hardening)
- Pipeline/Stage seeding now runs at tenant registration and onboarding skip — `auto_create_lead` in messengers no longer fails for new tenants.
- Distribution: added synonym fallback (`new_deal` ↔ `new_lead`) in `try_distribute()`; default rule trigger changed to `new_deal`.
- Session: refresh cookie `SameSite` set to `Lax` in dev, `None` in production; `secure=not DEBUG`.
- `auto_create_lead` wrapped in try/except with error logging to `message.error`.
- Quick-create contact/company buttons added to DealsView create/edit forms.
- Added `builtin_crm` to `DistributionLog.SOURCE_CHOICES`.

### Fixed (DEC-031: UI Error Handling)
- 11 views/components: added `catch` blocks with PrimeVue Toast notifications for all API calls.
- `<PToast />` placed in `App.vue`.
- `stores/tenant.ts`: added `planLoaded` getter; `hasFeature` checks `plan !== null` before feature lookup.
- `DashboardView`, `AppMenu`: feature-dependent blocks defer locking until plan data is loaded.
- `SameSite=None` always for refresh cookie (cross-origin `fetch()` requirement).
- `auth.ts`: `isAuthenticated` uses token presence, not user object; catch in `initialize()` no longer clears `tenant_slug`.
- `http.ts`: `refreshAccessToken()` catch no longer calls `setAccessToken(null)` on error.

### Added
- `frontend/nginx.conf`: `/static/` location for Django collected-static from shared volume; `/assets/` with immutable long-term cache.
- `frontend/src/router/guards.ts`: token-presence guard — if token exists but user data missing (page refresh race), fetches `me()` before redirecting to login.
- `vps-deployment/`: production deployment configuration (Docker Compose, deploy script, env template).
- CHANGELOG.md
